"# House-rent-prediction-using-IBM-Watson-Studio-Machine-learning" 

House rent price prediction is the process of estimating the rental price of residential properties based on various factors and data analysis. It involves using statistical models, machine learning algorithms, and historical rental data to predict the rent that a particular property is likely to command in the market.

In this project, we present a house rent prediction technique that utilizes historical data to train simple machine learning models, which are more accurate and can help us predict the rent of the house. The evaluation results show that the accuracy of the models is good enough to be used alongside the current state-of-the-art techniques.

Here, we have two pickle files, namely model.pkl (This file consists of a comparison of the Linear Regression model, Random Forest Regressor Model, and Gradient Boosting Regressor Model. However, attempting to access this .pkl file leads to the following error: 
_**("Internal Server Error - The server encountered an internal error and was unable to complete your request. Either the server is overloaded or there is an error in the application."))**_

Therefore, we will be using another file, rf_rand_model.pkl, which contains only the Random Forest regression model. This model demonstrates higher predictive capability and relatively lower RMSE (Root Mean Square Error).

However, please note that the rf_rand_model.pkl file has a larger file size, and it has been uploaded to Github repository via GIT. Consequently, when cloning the repository or downloading the project from the repository, the .pkl file will not be included in the pre-trained model. To resolve this issue, you can either save the pickle files by running the ipynb files again or use the following Google Drive link to directly access the pickle files.
